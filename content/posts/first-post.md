I just opened this blog but i actually wanted to start blogging years ago. Whenever i try to open a blog i lose my motivation in the search of perfection.

Today started as another day i try to open my website (i searched every static site generators, plug and play platforms like tumblr, ghost themes) just as i started losing my motivation an hour ago i promised myself to finally open it today. I downloaded [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) which is the platform i found most suitable. Tested it locally then configured my VPS with nginx and supervisor. Here i am writing my very first post which i had planned to write years ago, so today is a special day for me.

#### I finally did it, yayy!!!

From now on i'm gonna try not overthinking things.

Altough i started using ghost an hour ago i find it delighting, it feels you at home without slowing you down. Soon i'll write a blog post about my experience with [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) after spending some serious time with it.
